# shapes

Through code and script, draws various shapes via meshes and colors them randomly (either a single color or multiple).
  To change color, double click within the bounds of the mesh.
  A menu button has been included where the user can select which shape to have drawn and colored.
  All buttons have a simple click sound that will play when pressed.
Also included is a very simple wheel game, where the user can press a button to spin the wheel.
  The wheel will accelerate, spin at a constant speed, then decelerate to the final stop position.
  After stopping a text box will display showing how much the user "won".
  A simple song will play on loop while the wheel spins.
  When the wheel stops, the song stops and a celebratory sound will play when the win amount is shown.
  
Provided is a desktop build and an android apk.  I built the iOS version just fine, but due to size limitations on github I could not include it. (there is a file a couple hundred MBs large).
The builds are located in the Builds directory, should work standalone.
